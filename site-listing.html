                    <p>If you are planning to do any kind of Trekking in Nepal and then please don’t miss to do 1/2 days
                        Heritage tour in Nepal. One of the most sacred Hindu temples in the world, Pashupatinath is a
                        millennia old temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple complex consists of the main temple and
                        compound, surrounded by a variety of smaller temples, ashrams and sculptures and is bordered by
                        the holy Bagmati River to the east. Entry to the main temple is allowed only for Hindus but
                        everyone is free to observe from the hills beside the Bagmati riverbanks. Observing the various
                        rituals, ceremonies as well as funeral is a fascinating experience for tourists. A testament to
                        the importance of this temple is the sheer amount of pilgrims it attracts, particularly during
                        the holy occasions like Teej and Shivaratri where visitors number to hundreds of thousands in a
                        single day. The Pashupatinath Temple was one of the first sites in Nepal to be designated as a
                        UNSECO World Heritage Site (1979).

                    <p>If Pashupatinath is the holiest Hindu temple in Kathmandu, then its Buddhist counterpart has to
                        be the Boudhanath Stupa. There are a number of Newar as well as Tibetan Buddhist myths and
                        legends surrounding this amazing stupa's origin while some records state that it was built by a
                        Licchavi King Sivadeva as far back as the 5th Century CE. In present day, it is one of the
                        largest Buddhist stupas in the world and the whole surrounding area is a Buddhist-populated
                        settlement with over 40 monasteries nearby. A large number of tourists, pilgrims as well as
                        locals visit the Stupa every day, each for their own reasons. Chanting monks, spinning prayer
                        wheels, flocks of pigeons, and the smell of incense are just a few factors that make up the
                        unique atmosphere of this location.

                    <p>Swayambhunath Stupa is one of the oldest monuments in Nepal, with its origins being tied to the
                        origin of Kathmandu valley itself. Historical records and inscriptions have traced the origins
                        of this stupa complex as far back 1500 years ago while religious myths and stories go even
                        further. It is said that Swayambhunath, literally meaning self-sprung, was formed after the lake
                        dried out gave rise to the current valley. This hilltop stupa is an amazing mixture of Hindu
                        shrines and Buddhist stupas; two different forms of architecture co-existing in harmony. It is
                        said there are 365 steps on the stairs that lead up to Swayambhunath. Aside from being a holy
                        location for Hindus as well as Buddhists, the ideal location also means the view overlooking
                        most of the Kathmandu valley is superb from here.

                    <p>Considered as the oldest temple in all of Nepal, Changu Narayan is a Hindu temple dedicated to
                        Lord Vishnu. It is situated on a high hilltop that is also known as Changu or Dolagiri and is
                        surrounded by forest with a champak tree and a small village known as Changu Village. The temple
                        is located around 14 kilometers east of Kathmandu. The stone inscriptions and pillar along with
                        the temple and its various statues themselves have recorded it to be built as far back as the
                        464 AD. An information center as well as couple of museums are located in the vicinity if you
                        would like to dwell further into the rich history and fascinating myths of Changunarayan.

                        complex is an excellent showcase of Newari architecture and craftsmanship. The courtyard is
                        dotted with a number of Hindu as well as Buddhist monuments. Historical records have shown that

                        religious pilgrimage destination with a lot of history behind it. It was the last of the 4
                        locations in Nepal to be designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site (1997). Lumbini is best
                        known as the birthplace of Gautama Buddha. Also known as Siddhartha Gautama or Shakyamuni,
                        Buddha was a Shakya prince from around 3rd - 4th century BCE that spent decades in self-imposed
                        exile and eventually attained enlightenment to become the Buddha. His teaching came to be known
                        as Buddhism and spread all over the world through the years. As such, Lumbini is an immensely
                        important religious site for Buddhists. The major monuments and landmarks to explore here

                    <p>The final place on our list is the Sagarmatha National Park, which is the second National Park of
                        Nepal, being established in the year 1976. Just 3 years after its creation, it was designated as
                        a UNESCO World Heritage Site, owing to the immense amounts of cultural and natural wealth of
                        this region. The most recognizable part of the Sagarmatha National Park would most certainly be
                        Sagarmatha, or Mount Everest, which is the highest peak in the world at 8,848m. Aside from
                        Everest, the region is also home to some of the highest peaks in the world along with stunning
                        glaciers, valleys, rivers and mountains. The park itself stretches over an area of 1,148 sq. km.
                        It is home to a diverse variety of Himalayan flora and fauna including rhododendrons, blue pine,
                        silver fir and birch among others. While exploring the Sagarmatha National Park, there is also

                        cock, pheasant, snow pigeon etc. There are several trekking and climbing routes famous inside
                        this national park. Everest Base Camp Trek and Mount Everest Expedition is the most amazing trip
